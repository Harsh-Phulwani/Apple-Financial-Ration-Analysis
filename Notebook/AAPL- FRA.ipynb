    "This project evaluates a company’s financial performance and financial health using historical financial statements and **ratio-based analysis** implemented in Python. The objective is to translate raw accounting data into decision-useful insights from an investment perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project begins with data loading and cleaning, where raw financial statement data is structured for analysis by setting appropriate indices, standardizing column names, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent data types. Next, in the variables and calculation section, key financial line items such as revenue, operating income, net income, assets, equity, and liabilities are extracted and prepared. These variables form the foundation for ratio computation and trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The financial ratio calculations section uses the extracted variables to compute key profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency ratios, with clear formulas and comments linking each metric to its economic interpretation. This is followed by a year-over-year (YoY) analysis that examines trends in margins, returns, liquidity, and capital structure, focusing on consistency, volatility, and directional changes rather than single-year performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the project concludes with an overall conclusion, summarizing the company’s overall financial quality and highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and forward-looking implications."
